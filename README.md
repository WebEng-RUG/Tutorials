# Web Engineering Tutorials

This repository contains pieces of an example version of the project to be performed for the course Web Engineering taught at RuG. The work centers around a series of tutorials taught throughout the course, all working on building out the same application.

This repository currently does not contain anything, but new components and parts will be added over time after each tutorial, so stay tuned!
