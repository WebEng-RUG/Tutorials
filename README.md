# Web Engineering Tutorials

This repository contains pieces of an example version of the project to be performed for the course Web Engineering taught at RuG. The work centers around a series of tutorials taught throughout the course, all working on building out the same application.

This repository currently contains an API specification (in `./specification`) in OpenAPI 3.x format. More, content will be added along with the tutorials taking place.

You can quickly start exploring/editing without cloning the repository in two ways:

- Open the code in an editor online: press `Ctrl+Shift+K` in your browser, type "github.dev" and choose "Open in github.dev editor". You will see an online editor with all this code to explore.
- Open the code on your own machine, but remotely. Make sure to install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the ["Remote Development"](ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) and ["GitHub Repositories"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) plugins. Then, open a new window in VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type "github repositories open" and choose the respective option, then pase the URL of this repository. The repository will open in a local editor, with all the files remotely mounted.

Of course, you can always clone or fork this repository and start from there.

Any suggestions for improvement are more than welcome!
